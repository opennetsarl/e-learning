## Guidelines for Video Translation

To contribute to the translation of videos into different languages, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Configure an **Odoo Community v17.0** database with demo data.
2. Install the following modules:
   - **Contact**
   - **Sales**
   - **Dashboards**
   - **Invoicing**
   - **Purchase**
   - **Inventory**
   - **Employees**

### Translation Process

1. **Use the English text file as a reference** to translate it into your desired language.
   - Links to the files in the repository:
     - [English Translation File](#transcripts)
     - [French Translation File](#transcripts)

2. **Record your video** using the screen capture tool of your choice.  
   - Ensure all elements from the text are presented clearly.  
   - Try to match the length of the original French video as closely as possible.

### Video Specifications

- **Resolution:** 1920 x 1080  
- **Format:** MP4  
- **Framerate:** 30 fps (at least)

### Submission

Send your completed video to:  
**[support@open-net.ch](mailto:support@open-net.ch)**  

Please include the following information:  
- A profile photo (optional)  
- The name of your company (if desired)  
- Your job title  

### Post-Processing and Publication

1. Open Net will edit your video for final presentation.  
2. The video will then be sent to **Virginie Dewulf** for publication on the OCA YouTube channel.  
3. Once published, Open Net will update the module to include a link to the English video.

## Transcripts

For a detailed list of transcript files used in the E-Learning videos, refer to the [TRANSCRIPT.md](./TRANSCRIPT.md) file.

This file contains:
- Links to all transcript files in the `transcript` directory.
- Files categorized by language (French and English).


### Naming Conventions
When adding new transcript files, follow this naming convention:
- Start with a numeric identifier (e.g., `1`, `2`, `10`) for sorting.
- Use descriptive names that match the video's content.
- Include the language code at the end in parentheses, e.g., `(FR)` for French or `(EN)` for English.

Example:  
`1 OCA Learning Home page (EN).txt`

If you need to add or update a transcript, ensure it follows these conventions and is correctly placed in the `transcript` directory.

## Additional Notes
