Employees, contacts, any application opens from here. Then, you have these two icons that show notifications related to discussions. So this is where colleagues could send you messages. Here is the icon related to activities. So this is where you would see if you have any activities to do today or overdue, as is the case for this good document here. The name of the company. By clicking on it, if you are in a multi-company environment, this is where you will be able to change environments and change companies. And then, here, when you click on your avatar, you will be able to access the Odoo documentation or you will be able to access the support and create a first-level support ticket to exchange with Odoo about a question you may have.

The shortcut that allows you, for example, to open an application that is also accessible by clicking Ctrl + K on your keyboard, so here we will return to the contacts application and the part. From your preferences, which are available from your profile, where you will be able to define how you want to receive notifications. You will be able to define your signature that will be used in each of the exchanges you have with the outside.

If you want to change your password as well as a certain number of personal information that allows you to access the application, therefore everything that happens in this menu right at the top.
