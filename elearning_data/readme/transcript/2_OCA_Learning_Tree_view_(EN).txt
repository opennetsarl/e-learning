We will see in this video how the views listed in Odoo work. Here, for example, in the Contacts application or in any other application you open in Odoo, you have the option at the top right to select the listed views. In these views, you will always have the option to select a certain number of fields here or to hide others. For example, here we will remove the activities and add the mobile phone. It is also possible on most fields to sort them in ascending or descending alphabetical order. If you want to see all recordings at once, you can click on the button in the column. By default, a certain number of records are displayed. In my example, only twenty contacts are displayed.

To display the following records, simply click on the right or left arrows to navigate to the next or previous pages. If you wish to see all the recordings at once, you can click on the button in the column. You can go here to select the number, add a 0 for example to exceed the total number of records, press Enter, and now all 57 records are displayed. On a list view, you have the possibility to select a certain number of records that will grant you access to bulk actions. For example, you can archive all 5 selected contacts at once by clicking on the action. According to the applications, various actions will be suggested to you. For example, in accounting, you could send multiple invoices at once this way. Multiple selection also allows you to mass update data. You can, for example, update data in the same way. You can also update the seller of these 5 contacts at once. This feature should be used with caution, as you can imagine. In wide-ranging applications, you have this list view that is widely used. There are also a certain number of other views that are available and that we will be able to see later.
