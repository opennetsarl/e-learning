In this video, the idea is to go a little more into detail, into the customization of the features that can be found in this search bar, whether it's at the level of filters or at the level of groupings. We will specifically go to these custom sections, which is true here, and also true for contacts, for articles, for invoices, or anywhere you see this filter bar. Here, for example, you may want to group these contacts by state. You just need to add a custom group to see all the fields that are available and that you can use. And here, we see all the fields that are available and that you can use. And here, we see the state, which allows us to see those who are located in California, in Illinois, etc.

With the little cross, we can delete the grouping, and now we will go and see a little more in detail for the filters section. For example, here, we are going to create a filter to find all the contacts located in France, for example. I add this filter and that's it. I find three contacts who are located in France. I am removing this filter to make our example. I will now take an example where I want to find all the people who are in Pleasant Hill, who contain the name of the city "Pleasant," where I want to find all the contacts that are in Pleasant Hill, who contain the name of the city "Pleasant." And among these people, I only want to recover the analysts. So I come to add a new filter or existing filter.

And there, I will take the people whose position is that of an analyst. And so, I find myself with Floyd Stewart, who is the only person living in Pleasant Hill and being an analyst. Similarly, one might have wanted to know all the people who live in Pleasant Hill or who are analysts. And so, it is done in the following manner. So here, we mention the name of the city by saying that it contains Pleasant Hill. Okay, that's enough. And we're going to add the rule about the position here. This means that we no longer want people who live in Pleasant Hill and are analysts, but since we are matching at least one of the following rules here, we will have all people who are analysts or who are located in Pleasant Hill. And so, here we are with four people. From here, we could have made the change and said that we wanted all of these conditions to be met by those who live in Pleasant Hill and who are analysts; we end up with another Floyd Stewart. Here is how to easily add filters and groupings to have a very powerful search tool with all these customizations, whether it's truly at the filter level or at the grouping level.
