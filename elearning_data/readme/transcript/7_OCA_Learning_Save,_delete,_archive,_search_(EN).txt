In this video, I will explain to you how record modifications work, their recording, deletion, and archiving. By default, when you arrive here, for example on a contact sheet, it would be the same on an article sheet or on an invoice or on a purchase order, there is no need to do anything special to start making modifications. In some software, you have to first indicate that you want to enter edit mode before modifying elements. In Odoo, it is much simpler. By default, if you touch something, it means you want to change it. So for example, Tony Riménez, I note that she is a consultant, I started typing without doing anything more and it came to edit her employee record. Every time a modification is made, you will see a registration record appear here.

It is a registration form. It is a registration form. It is this little cloud that allows either to force manual recording or to ignore the changes that have just been made. For example, here, I will ignore my change and I will go to another employee record and I will say that Tina Williamson is now called Tina Williamson Write, and I can force the registration in this way. However, it is not necessary to force the registration. The recording is automatic in Odoo. For example, Ronnie Hart Test, if I change employee, well finally, it will automatically come to backup. And you see here that his name has changed without me needing to mention that I wanted to save. So be careful, it is very powerful and allows you to save a lot of time.

But basically, everything you touch in Odoo, every time you make a change, well, it will automatically save. It's very powerful, and by default, when you open a record, it goes into editing mode. In Odoo, it is possible to archive employees or to delete them. So, there, for example, I am going to archive Toni Jiménez and so she is still present in the database. I have the possibility to make it appear by saying that I want to see the people who have been archived, like this. There, it no longer appears since it is archived. So she is inactive, but I can still make her appear. On the other hand, if I delete her employee record, at that time, she will completely disappear from the database and we will not be able to reactivate it.

You see here, she is no longer here and she is no longer in the archives either. It is important to distinguish between the concept of archiving and the concept of deletion. Last element in terms of changes in Odoo that you need to be careful with. For example, here, if you wanted to change Rachel Perry's mentor and you're looking for someone, like John Doe, who doesn't exist, well, you quickly, without paying attention, by starting to type and click Enter, actually create a user. Here, you have created the mentor named John Doe. So, this will have created a contact in the database. You see, every time I start typing, if there are no criteria, no contact that meets these criteria, well, you have the option to Create or Create and edit. That means you are going to create a record in the database. We must be careful with that as well. It can be interesting, but one just needs to be aware of what they are doing. Here are a few key points to know regarding modifications, saving, archiving, and deletion. From one end to the other.
