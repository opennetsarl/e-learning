In this video, we will analyze how one can do all the reporting part with an example on sales. If we go to the analysis menu in the sales section, here is how it is presented with a screen, a filter section here in the middle, at the top, on the right, at the top, we choose what the output is, whether we want a pivot table or a graph. Then, here we will be able to work a little bit on the graph and the details of the graph, and thus the display on the screen in the middle of the screen, we will start by defining which filters correspond to the analysis we want to perform. So, here we are on the middle screen. We will start by defining which filters correspond to the analysis we want to carry out.

So, here we are on the purchase orders from the last 365 days, that's perfect. And we will focus first on the visualization of the graphs, the first thing: determine which measure we want to analyze. So, here we are on the total excluding taxes, we could definitely analyze the number of these purchase orders that have been completed in the last 365 days. We will stick with the total excluding taxes. Here, we have the option to either choose a chart. Bars, either a linear graph or a pie chart. Every time we choose a graph, we have the possibility to either say that it is stacked or also to sort it, either in ascending or descending order. Here, we are looking at daily sales.

One could completely group together and say that we want to look at sales by week, so week 24, 25, 26, etc. Here is a first example that we will also stack by client, for example, and there we see the sales per week and per client for the data scopes we are working on. We will now move on. In pivot table mode, in the same way, we will choose which measure we are working on, and then here you will be able to group and expand a pivot table as in a classic spreadsheet. For example, here we are going to redo our analysis on a weekly basis and then we will say that we will do an analysis on a weekly and monthly basis.

And next week, following the same model, we will carry out a sale to thus obtain here for each of the sellers, what have been their statistics per week. Here it allows us to switch the axes if necessary. Wanted the weeks that are in a column and the vendors that are in a row. In addition to that, we could also add the customers, for example, and here I find myself with the details of the customers to highlight words on all of these purchase orders. This icon here allows to unfold everything, and therefore also to unfold for Mitchell Admin, all clients who have purchase orders with him. This icon here allows you to download a file in spreadsheet format. This final section here is a list view that will allow us to see all the purchase orders that are within the scope of this search. Well, don't forget. Not all the graphs, whether visual or in the form of a pivot table, are interactive here.
