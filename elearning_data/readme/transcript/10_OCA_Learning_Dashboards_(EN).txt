In this video, I will present to you the dashboard application that allows you to have, at a glance, the figures of each of the applications. So here at the top you have the filter bar of the dashboard and on the left you have all the dashboards that are available. For example, if we look at the purchasing dashboard here, we have the option to filter by country, by supplier, by product category, by product, and by buyer. Here are presented the main metrics for purchases. Here, an evolution over time if there were more data, we would see the graph show the evolution over time of purchases and below, lists in relation to the best countries, best price demands, and best orders.

What is important to know is that in these dashboards everything is dynamic, so it is entirely possible if something seems strange to us, for example, purchase order number 4, here we have the possibility to click on it to open it directly and access the details of this purchase order. In the same way, the filter can be applied to this provider by clicking on it, and there we saw that the filter had been added. It is entirely possible to then remove the filter to see the full dashboard view again, and so on. In the same way for categories or for any other filter that would be available here. And then you can simply navigate from dashboard to dashboard.
