In this video, the objective is to see what a form view looks like in Odoo. For example, in this list of articles, this is what the form view looks like, the form view of an article, but it's also the case for a contact, for an employee, for any reference data. At the top left here, you know that you are on products, that you are looking at this product from a cabinet door, and by clicking on new, you have the opportunity to create a new product. In the middle of the screen appear what are called Odoo's Smart Buttons, intelligent buttons, which allow you to be connected to what you are currently viewing, so here to the wardrobe article with a door.

So, if you click on forecasts, reference data appears, reference data appears, reference data appears, forecasts of stock for this specific item. In the same way, for sales, you see all the sales of this item. It is true again for all reference data, whether it be contacts or other types of entities. At the top right here, you have the option to navigate between all the articles in the database. Below here appear the most common actions that can be performed on an article here, in this example with updating the quantity, restocking, or printing labels. A certain number of actions also appear in this small gear icon, where you can, for example, generate the price list report for this item. At the bottom, all the information and configurations that can be made for this product appear long. Don't forget the tabs that allow you to separately configure sales information for this item, purchasing information, inventory, accounting, etc. depending on all the modules you will have installed on your database. And on the right side of the screen appears the chat box for which we will have a dedicated video to explain the entire operation to you.
