In this video, we will focus on the main search screen of Oodoo. This search bar section is divided into three parts: a left side for filters, a middle part for groupings, and a right side where favorites can be defined. At the filter level, you have the ability to modify the selection by clicking directly on one of the preconfigured filters. So here, for example, by clicking on companies, I have all the companies that are defined in Oodoo. When you define preconfigured filters that appear, which belong to the same group, so not separated by a horizontal line, it means that we will retrieve all companies or individuals here. On the other hand, if you select two preconfigured filters that are not in the same section, then it is an "and" that will apply.

So, here, we will select all the customer companies only. In Odoo, it is also possible to search by value. For example, if you type "ge" here and then hit "enter," it will search for all the people whose name contains "je," so here "Jesse Brown," "Jeffrey Kelly," etc. But when you do a search like that in a text field in Odoo, you not only have the possibility to search by name, which is done by default, but you can also search in another field. So there, for example, I am going to retrieve all contacts whose email contains "odoo". com ». And there, I come across two contacts, Marc Desmeaux and Rachel Perry, who match this search. Now that we have seen the filters, we will move on to the "grouping" part.

So Odoo allows you in a single click to group, here, for example, all contacts by company. So there, I didn't apply any filters, I simply have a grouping and I see that I have three contacts for "Azure Intérieur", three for "Deco Addict", etc., etc. Groupings can be done at several levels. So there, we have a first level of grouping by company, and below the company, we could group by city. So, if I expand "Azure Intérieur", I see that all the contacts are in the city of Frémont. On the other hand, for "Deco Addict", I see that there are two contacts in "Pleasant Hill" and one contact in "Scranton". It was for the "grouping" part. And now, I have the opportunity to save one of my searches.

For example, earlier, I was on the client companies and I would like to be able to easily return to this filter. Well, I have the option here to save a "Company" favorite. Client that I will eventually share with my other colleagues in the company who will see it appear. And so, from now on, when I come back here on the screen, if I go back to contacts, I have the possibility to directly apply my filter which can be much more complicated than the two simple filters I applied, 'Company'. and 'Customer invoices' Only to see what is stored in this filter.
