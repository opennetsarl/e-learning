In this video, we will therefore explain and focus on that part called the chat box which is the space for exchanges in Odoo. This is a space you find here on an employee record and you find it in the same way on a purchase order, on a sales order or on a quote, on any Odoo entity, you have access to this discussion space. For example, on a contact sheet, in a way we have this chat box that appears either on the right side or, depending on the size of your screen, it will appear below. It is at this place that, for example, we will be able to check which modifications have been made. If for example I rename this company Gemini Furniture Inc, then we will ensure and we will see who has changed what information.

So here it's me Michel Admin and I came to rename the name of this company. It is here that all traceability will be done for this entity, in this case, the company. You see these three buttons appear, especially these two that allow you to exchange the note button that allows internal exchange, as you can see here, it says: 'Record an internal note'. So, there, I will be able, for example, to ask my colleague: 'Is the email correct?' and then, when I publish, I have the confidence that it is only internal because it was a note. On the contrary, I could definitely send a message to Gemini Furniture Inc asking them to confirm their email address. And there, at that moment, the message will be sent outside to Gemini Furniture Inc and you see that the message appears in green; besides, it is important to distinguish sending a message outside, sending a note, we stay internally within the company and can tag the people who come to give us a response.

It is also possible in this chat to add documents, either by simply dragging and dropping them or by adding an attachment as I am currently doing, and there we have the attachment that is added to the conversation, as we could have done. For a contact, for an invoice, or for anything else. Here, we have a little man. So there, it's this little paperclip that represents the number of attached files that can be hidden or displayed. Attention, sometimes it's hidden by default, but they are indeed there. And here, it allows to know who are the subscribers to this company file, in this case, in such a way that as soon as there is an exchange, Michel Admin will be informed, even if it is another user who comes to write things at the level of this discussion space, at the level of this chat.

And you can absolutely add subscribers here, whether they are internal to the company or external to the company. The last thing to see in this communication space is the activities. So here, for example, I will set myself a reminder. So it's all. It is a contextual list that will remind us for contacts, for articles, for quotes, for purchase orders, that will remind us on a given date, what we need to do. So, here, let's say verify that the email address is received correctly. I will set this for a deadline in one week. I plan and when the time comes, I will have a reminder that will appear here, at the top. In the list of activities, there, I would have a number 6 that would appear indicating that for this contact, there is something to check. Here are the main features of what you can find in this exchange space, for discussion, what we call the Odoo chatter.
