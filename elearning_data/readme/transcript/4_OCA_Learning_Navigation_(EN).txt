In this video, we will look at some concepts related to navigating the United Nations. There, for example, by clicking once, I open the voucher P00011 and what is important to understand is the breadcrumb trail that you find here in the top left. For example, if I open the reception that is associated with this purchase order, I can return to the purchase order that was here and even return to all of the price requests that were previously selected. It is with this thread of Ariadne that you can do this. Every time in Odoo that you see there is a hyperlink, so there you see that the dates are in black and that we cannot click on them. On the other hand here, when I hover over the supplier, I already see that the voucher P00011 is in black and cannot be clicked on.

On the other hand, here, the supplier, when I hover over it, I already see that there is a link and the text is in purple. And when I pass my mouse over it, I see a little hand that appears, which means that I can click on it and it will open up the associated provider. And this allows me to navigate gradually in order to understand what I am looking at. I returned to my purchase order and something else that is important in Odoo and really helps to increase productivity are the shortcuts. So if you press the Alt key on your keyboard, you will see all the shortcuts that appear. For example, in the top right, I see that N for Next or P for Previous allows me to navigate from voucher to voucher to eventually go back to the first one I was on.

Alt C allows me to create a new voucher here. In Odoo, entering information is made easy with, for example, the ability to enter dates using shortcuts. Yes, for example, if I simply enter 17, it will take me to the 17th of the month. I do not need to enter the date entirely. In the same way, in terms of quantity, I can completely grasp a formula. Yes, for example, if I have to buy 6 dozen, all I have to do is 6 x 12 and the quantity will be displayed automatically. Another important thing in Odoo that helps save time is working with multiple screens. So there, I have my first window that is open, but I have the option, by selecting, for example, here the products, by right-clicking, I have the possibility to open the link in a new tab. I can find the tab, which will allow me to work with a window on the right for the articles and a window on the left for my purchase orders, for example.
